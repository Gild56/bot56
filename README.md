# Bot56 (or Bot57)

Bot56 is my personal Discord bot. You can guess levels positions in the Demonlist with it!

Join my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/D4mUZtkAMY) :)

## Commands:

``/say [text]`` makes the bot write your message (no images obviously)

``/guess`` makes the bot send 3 pictures, your goal is to guess that level's position in the [Demonlist](https://demonlist.org). 25 levels are available for now, if you want to contibute to that project, please read the [contributing guidelines file](CONTRIBUTING.md), you are welcome :D
