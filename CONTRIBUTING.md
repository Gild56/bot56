# Contributing

It is very simple to participate to that project: to add a level you only need to create a folder in ``src/images/`` with the **exact** level's name as written in the [Demonlist](https://demonlist.org).

Then, you can add 3 images into that folder, the name of these images isn't important.

## Guidelines for the images

Images need to be entire screenshots 16/9 and good quality.

We need to see the actual gameplay - think about the people who will play it!
